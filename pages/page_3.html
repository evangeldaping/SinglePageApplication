		<br>
		
		<strong>Carrot</strong>, (<em>Daucus carota</em> subsp. <em>sativus</em>) is a root vegetable, usually orange in colour, though purple, black, red, white, and yellow cultivars exist.[1] They are a domesticated form of the wild carrot, Daucus carota, native to Europe and Southwestern Asia. The plant probably originated in Persia and was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. The most commonly eaten part of the plant is the taproot, although the stems and leaves are eaten as well. The domestic carrot has been selectively bred for its greatly enlarged, more palatable, less woody-textured taproot.
		
		<br><br>
		
		The carrot is a biennial plant in the umbellifer family Apiaceae. At first, it grows a rosette of leaves while building up the enlarged taproot. Fast-growing cultivars mature within three months (90 days) of sowing the seed, while slower-maturing cultivars need a month longer (120 days). The roots contain high quantities of alpha- and beta-carotene, and are a good source of vitamin K and vitamin B6, but the belief that eating carrots improves night vision is a myth put forward by the British in World War II to mislead the enemy about their military capabilities.

				<h1 align="center" style="background-color:#123456; color: white;">13 Incredible Benefits Of Carrots<br>You Must Know Today</h1>

				<br>

				<h3>What Are The Health Benefits Of Eating Carrots?</h3>

				<br><br>

				<strong>1. Help Prevent Cancer</strong>

				<br><br>

				Carrots contain numerous phytochemicals that are well-studied for their anticancer properties . A few of these compounds include beta-carotene and other carotenoids. These compounds promote immunity and activate certain proteins that inhibit cancer cells. Studies show that the juice from carrots can combat leukemia as well.
				
				<br><br>
				
				Carrots are also found to lower oral cancer risk.
				 
				<br><br>

				<strong>2. Promote Eye Health</strong>

				<br><br>

				Vitamin A in recommended quantities is essential for good vision, and carrots offer the nutrient in abundance. If a person is deprived of vitamin A for too long, the outer segments of the eyes’ photoreceptors begin to deteriorate. This disrupts the normal chemical processes involved in vision. Restoring your vitamin A intake can facilitate restoration of your vision .

				<br><br>

				<strong>3. Might Enhance Hair Growth</strong>

				<br><br>

				Carrots are powerhouses of vitamins A and C, carotenoids, potassium, and other antioxidants – all of which contribute to hair health. There is limited research on this, though.

				<br><br>

				<strong>4. Promote Skin Health</strong>

				<br><br>

				Carrots are rich in carotenoids. Research suggests that fruits and vegetables rich in these compounds can improve complexion and one’s overall appearance. They achieve this by giving your skin a healthy glow. Be mindful, though – overconsuming carrots ((or other foods high in carotenoids) can result in a condition called carotenosis, wherein your skin appears yellow or orange. 

				<br><br>

				<strong>5. Regulate Blood Pressure</strong>

				<br><br>

				A recent study claimed that carrot juice contributed to a 5% reduction in systolic blood pressure. The nutrients present in carrot juice, including fiber, potassium, nitrates, and vitamin C – are found to aid this effect.

				<br><br>

				<strong>6. Aid Diabetes Treatment</strong>	

				<br><br>

				Following a healthy, balanced diet and maintaining a healthy weight can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. Studies show that high blood levels of vitamin A may lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. Carrots, being abundant in this nutrient, make for an ideal addition to a diabetic meal.
				
				<br><br>

				<strong>7. Boost Immunity</strong>	

				<br><br>

				Vitamin A regulates the functioning of your system and prevents infections. It achieves this by boosting your body’s immunity. Get this immune-boosting vitamin from carrots. Carrots also contain vitamin C. This nutrient further contributes to strengthening the immune system.
				
				<br><br>

				<strong>8. Strengthen Bones</strong>	

				<br><br>

				Vitamin A influences bone cell metabolism. The beta-carotene in carrots is a strong antioxidant that is associated with bone health.
				
				<br><br>

				<strong>9. May Aid Weight Loss</strong>	

				<br><br>

				Raw, fresh carrots are about 88% water. A medium carrot has only about 25 calories. Hence, including carrots in your diet is a smart way of fill yourself up without piling on calories.
				 
				<br><br>
				
				Carrots also contain fiber. A study showed that meals containing whole and blended carrots resulted in higher satiety levels in the test subjects.
				
				<br><br>

				<strong>10. Lower Cholesterol Levels</strong>	

				<br><br>

				Carrot consumption reduces cholesterol absorption and increases the antioxidant status of your body. These effects can also promote cardiovascular health. Raw carrots are also rich in a fiber called pectin that helps lower cholesterol.
				 
				<br><br>

				<strong>11. Are Good For The Teeth And Gums</strong>	

				<br><br>

				Crisp and raw carrots help clear plaque from the teeth and freshen your breath. The fibrous carrots also increase salivation, which can neutralize the citric and malic acids usually left behind in your mouth.
				 
				<br><br>

				<strong>12. Promote Liver Health And Eliminate Toxins</strong>	

				<br><br>

				Carrots contain glutathione, a supermolecule that helps detoxify the liver. The veggies are also high in plant flavonoids and beta-carotene, both of which stimulate and support your overall liver function. The vitamin A in carrots also combats liver diseases.
				 
				<br><br>

				<strong>13. Help Treat PCOS</strong>	

				<br><br>

				Carrots are non-starchy veggies with a low glycemic index – and may help treat PCOS. There is limited research in this regard, though.

				<h1 align="center" style="background-color:#123456; color: white;">10 Things You Probably Didn’t Know<br>About Carrots</h1>

				<br>

				<em>Whether you are talking about wild or domestic carrots, chances are this is one of your favorite vegetables. Belonging to the species daucus carota, you can find carrots all around the world, as they remain a star vegetable in many cuisines. But what do you really know about this biannual plant? We delved into its history and biology and found 10 interesting facts that will make you want to eat this vegetable even more.</em>

				<br><br>

				<strong>1. Carrots were first grown in Afghanistan</strong>
				
				<br><br>
				
				While carrots are a common vegetable throughout the world, the first cultivated carrot in recorded history is thought to have come from the area around Afghanistan around 900 AD. Soon, this tasty veg spread to the surrounding areas and by the 1000s, it was in the Middle East and North Africa. From there it traveled to Spain, and by the 1300s it was popping up in Northern European gardens and in various dishes in China.
					
				<br><br>

				<strong>2. Crème de Lite, Long Orange and Scarlet Nantes are all types of carrots</strong>
				
				<br><br>
				
				Even though they are split into two categories, domestic and wild, there are more types of carrots than you have ever imagined. Long Oranges, tiny and stout Early Short Horns or their cousins the thin Half-Long Horns, the giant Jaune Obtuse du Doubs, fat Danvers, long and skinny Imperators, round Paris Markets and perfectly even Berlicums — just to name a few of the root shapes you can find. Then, you go into strains of carrots where you have the Crème de Lite, Sirkana, Top Cut, Red Core Chantenay, Scarlet Nantes and — in the spirit of Game of Thrones — Little Finger, a small orange specimen developed in France. 

				<br><br>

				<strong>3. Baby carrots aren’t a type of carrot</strong>
				
				<br><br>
				
				With all that talk about carrot varietals, we had to address the phenomenon of baby carrots. Turns out they are either immature carrots, hence their small size, or pieces of larger, thin carrots that are cut into pieces. The latter idea came from Mike Yurosek, a California farmer who got tired of chucking blemished carrots away and started cutting and peeling the vegetables into tiny perfection. In 2010, carrot farmers got together and started promoting baby carrots as an alternative snack food — a successful campaign that has plenty of people snacking on carrots instead of chips.

				<br><br>

				<strong>4. You can leave them in the ground all winter</strong>
				
				<br><br>
				
				While so many wimpy vegetables need to be plucked and dug up, the mighty carrot can freeze itself happily in the ground. “After the carrots have had a light frost you cover them with about a foot of leaf mulch, which acts like insulation to prevent the ground and the carrots from freezing solid,” says farmer Toby Fischer of Ro-Jo Farms in Bethany, Connecticut. “You can either over-winter carrots and harvest them in the spring, or continuously harvest them throughout the winter months.” And when you do this, the carrot’s sugars get more concentrated and the result is a super tasty, sweet vegetable that anybody who loves dessert will be excited to eat.

				<br><br>

				<strong>5. Carrots are made up of 88 percent water</strong>
				
				<br><br>
				
				That’s right. While you try and alleviate hunger in a healthy way by chowing on carrots, most of what you are getting is water. Not that that’s a bad thing. In comparison, on average we humans are made of a measly 60 percent water.

				<br><br>

				<strong>6. Carrots come in many colors</strong>
				
				<br><br>
				
				Forget orange. You can get carrots in other natural hues of white, yellow and a deep shade of purple, if you look for them. Funnily enough, the first documented carrots were actually purple or white in color. The orange vegetables we know today were developed after a genetic mutation caused purple carrots, which have a yellow-orange core, to lose their color and turn a solid orange. Given that carrots have approximately 20 species worldwide, it’s not surprising they come in various shades.

				<br><br>

				<strong>7. Cooking carrots is better for you than eating raw carrots</strong>
				
				<br><br>
				
				As the most popular and widely grown member of the apiaceae family, you want to respect the vegetable. This is why you should get the most out of each bite by cooking them. This releases the hidden pockets of good-for-you beta-carotene.<br><br>In fact, eating carrots raw only gives you three percent of this substance, but when you heat them up they release closer to 40 percent. So try these sweet vegetables puréed into soup, sliced thin onto a salad, braised in butter, baked, cooked until they are soft in a stew and stuffed into poultry.<br><br>Or, you can get funky with the root like chef Amanda Cohen does in her Manhattan restaurant Dirt Candy, though, she says, working with them isn’t always easy.<br><br>“Carrots are a blessing and a curse because they’re super-versatile, but their sweet taste can easily overwhelm a dish,” she says. “Because they’re sweet, but also a little bitter, kind of like the way lemon is sweet but also sour, at Dirt Candy we’ve found that they’re perfect for desserts, like our Carrot Meringue Pie.”<br><br>She adds that their indestructible texture also makes them a lot of fun, and that even if you grill a carrot for a long time, it will never turn mushy or lose shape. “That means we can grill them for ages,” Cohen says. “Then, we shave them with a peeler, and get a deep, complex flavor, with a hint of sweetness and a chewy texture.”

				<br><br>

				<strong>8. Carrots contain the richest sources of beta-carotene</strong>
				
				<br><br>
				
				You may wonder why you care about beta-carotene. Well, here’s the deal: This chemical is what gives fruits and vegetables a yellow-orange pigment that turns into vitamin A in our systems. While it won’t make you see in the dark, beta-carotene does help with eyesight, as well as boost the immune system and promote healthy skin.
				<br><br>

				<strong>9. Carrots have seeds</strong>
				
				<br><br>
				
				Bet you never thought about that one as you chomp on a smooth stalk of this sweet-orange vegetable. But it’s true. How else did you think they grew? You harvest the seeds from the tiny white flowers that grow out of the ground. Funnily enough, the carrot doesn’t produce a traditional seed, but instead it’s classified as a schizocarp, a dry fruit composed of multiple carpels that separate to release the seed inside. Researchers have even found that wild carrot seeds dating back about 5,000 years were discovered in Europe. Also, due to their aromatic qualities, the seeds have been used as a spice and in herbal medicine.

				<br><br>

				<strong>10. Carrots have sugar in them</strong>
				
				<br><br>

				Ha, and here you thought you were eating something healthy. Okay, well yes, you are, but carrots do contain four types of sugars  — sucrose, glucose, xylose and fructose. Luckily for you carb-a-phobes, despite the sugar they contain very little starch, so you can have your sweet vegetable without the carbs. Plus, even though they are on the saccharin side, you also get a whopping bunch of good-for-you nutrients including vitamins A, C, K and B6, manganese, calcium, lots of dietary fiber and potassium.
