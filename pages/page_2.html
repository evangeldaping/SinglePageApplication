		<br>
		
		<strong>Potato</strong>, (<em>Solanum tuberosum</em>), annual plant in the nightshade family (Solanaceae), grown for its starchy edible tubers. The potato is native to the Peruvian-Bolivian Andes and is one of the world’s main food crops. Potatoes are frequently served whole or mashed as a cooked vegetable and are also ground into potato flour, used in baking and as a thickener for sauces. The tubers are highly digestible and supply vitamin C, protein, thiamin, and niacin.
		
		<br><br>
		
		Potatoes are thought to have been independently domesticated several times and were largely cultivated in South America by the Incas as early as 1,800 years ago. Encountered by the invading Spaniards, potatoes were introduced into Europe during the second half of the 16th century. By the end of the 17th century the plant was a major crop in Ireland, and by the end of the 18th century it was a major crop in continental Europe, particularly Germany, and in the west of England.
		
		<br><br>
		
		It continued to spread, in both Western and Eastern hemispheres, during the first four decades of the 19th century, and the Irish economy itself became dependent upon the potato. However, the disastrous failures of the Irish crops in the mid-19th century (especially in 1846 and 1848), because of late blight (<em>Phytophthora infestans</em>), and the resulting Irish Potato Famine generated a more-cautious attitude toward dependence on the plant.

				<h1 align="center" style="background-color:#123456; color: white;">10 Health Benefits of Potatoes<br>You Didn’t Know About!</h1>

				<br>

				<h3>Why Potatoes?</h3>

				<em>Even though potatoes have sustained a somewhat tainted reputation, they are still one of the most-often used ingredients in recipes spanning breakfast through lunch and they have a vast health benefits, which are listed below: </em>

				<br><br>

				<strong>1. Positive Effect on Diabetes</strong>

				<br><br>

				Those with diabetes are always worried about raising blood glucose levels and so they avoid potatoes’ natural sugar content. In fact, avoidance isn’t necessary, but portion control is. Carbohydrates can be a healthy part of any diabetic meal plan when incorporated in correct portions. Talk to a doctor about managing diabetes through ideal servings.
				<br><br>

				<strong>2. Enhance General Health</strong>

				<br><br>

				The common thought is potatoes cause weight gain yet their caloric value is actually fairly low making them a good choice for meals. Potatoes also provide sustenance so feelings of hunger are averted for longer periods. They also provide a decrease in cholesterol levels because they are half soluble and half insoluble.

				<br><br>

				<strong>3. Remedy Bruising</strong>

				<br><br>

				For centuries, potatoes have been used for treating sprains, bruises, ulcers, and even burns, aiding in the healing process. They can also reduce the onset of skin ailments and the effects of narcotics. Studies have shown that potatoes are part of a group of cancer-fighting foods used to fight cancer of the uterus and prostate.

				<br><br>

				<strong>4. Relieve Stress</strong>

				<br><br>

				Stress on the body and mind can be eased by ingesting potatoes; cellular renewal is boosted by the rich source of vitamin B6 in potatoes. The creation of adrenaline hormones, which aid in fighting stress, is just one major benefit. They also produce GABA (Gamma Amino Butyric Acid), a hormone that can also reduce stress and help the brain ready itself for relaxation or sleep. 

				<br><br>

				<strong>5. Diminish Inflammation</strong>

				<br><br>

				Those who suffer from chronic internal or external inflammation can reap the benefits potatoes provide for this ailment. The make-up of a soft, baked potato is easily digestible, alleviating the digestive system from irritation. To ease any external inflammation, simply rub a raw potato on the affected area(s) including any ulcers that may be found in the mouth.

				<br><br>

				<strong>6. Improve Brain Functions</strong>	

				<br><br>

				Day to day activities and general health can be influenced greatly by adding potatoes into your diet. The high amounts of copper and iron, also known for boosting brain activity, are an added benefit. Preparing a baked potato and eating it, skin and all and without salt, can lead to an improved memory. Manganese, potassium, and vitamin B6 and C are each known to assist in functions of the brain while nerve centers respond positively to the fatty acids and amino acids found in potatoes.
				
				<br><br>

				<strong>7. Alleviate Kidney Stones</strong>	

				<br><br>

				Raised uric acid levels in the blood is the main contributor of kidney stones. The hard masses of calcium crystals in urine can create painful stones that are excruciating to pass. Those suffering from kidney stones can find many extra benefits from ingesting the entire potato peel, a rich source of such relieving nutrients as alkaline salts and the aforementioned copper, manganese, potassium, and B-vitamins.
				
				<br><br>

				<strong>8. High Fiber Content</strong>	

				<br><br>

				Eating high-fiber foods can be one of the best ways to achieve weight-loss success. Potatoes are a top high-fiber food and one of the best ingredients to use in moderation. While potatoes can be beneficial to your health, preparing them in a healthy way is crucial. Baking them is one of the best ways to reap all the  nutritional benefits.
				
				<br><br>

				<strong>9. Keep Diseases at Bay</strong>	

				<br><br>

				Decrease the risks of cancer, aid digestion, combat heart disease, and avoid common disorders in the nervous system, all by eating potatoes.
				
				<br><br>

				<strong>10. Treat Your Skin</strong>	

				<br><br>

				Treating skin ailments with potatoes is an inexpensive and natural way to look your best. Try a potato juice facial by topically applying it, or use sliced potatoes on eyelids to reduce the appearance of dark circles and swelling.

				<h1 align="center" style="background-color:#123456; color: white;">10 Things You Probably Didn’t Know<br>About Potatoes</h1>

				<br>

				<em>The <strong>potato</strong>. What do you really know about this popular vegetable, save for that it makes a great French fry and on Thanksgiving we eat them mashed? After all, this tuber has been related to a devastating famine, as in the Irish one that caused an eight-year food deficiency in 1845; was once worth its weight in gold during the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897 and the spuds didn’t land in Idaho until 1836.<br><br>Find out what other interesting things have we dug up (heh) about the potato.</em>

				<br><br>

				<strong>1. Each spud has a use</strong>
				
				<br><br>
				
				When it comes to starch, each potato has its own sugary profile, which makes them not only have contrasting tastes, but cook differently too. For example, have you ever ended up with a gummy, sticky mess of mashed potatoes? Chances are you used a high-starch spud like the Russet or Idaho. Next time, go for a lower starch option like the buttery Yukon Gold. It’s just the best way to do it. “Most potatoes can be used in a number of ways pretty well, they just may shine a bit more with a certain style of preparation,” says Evan Hanczor, chef at Egg restaurant in Brooklyn. For example, use the drier, starchier Russets for hash browns and French fries; long, waxy Fingerling potatoes for roasting and confiting; Russet Burbanks for potato chips and round, white Katahdins for baking or boiling.

				<br><br>

				<strong>2. There are many, MANY potatoes you haven’t heard of</strong>
				
				<br><br>
				
				Though you may only see a few varieties in the grocery store — mainly Russet, Yukon Gold and Red Bliss — there are hundreds of potatoes grown around the world, and new ones are being created all the time. “You get characteristics you think are good, and then it takes 10 to 12 years to develop,” says John Mishanec, who worked as a vegetable specialist at Cornell University for over 20 years. “From a grower’s perspective, you want a potato that does well year in, year out, and that’s why it takes 12 years to find a potato that will do well in all conditions.” Some recent potatoes that have made the scene in the Pacific Northeast include Adirondack Blue, Keuka Gold, Lehigh and Mishanec’s personal favorite, Eva. Head to your farmers’ market for local and heirloom spuds, and make sure to find out what potatoes you are buying. This way, says Mishanec, you can learn what kind of tubers you like, what they are good for and then get them again.

				<br><br>

				<strong>3. When you buy them, potatoes are still alive</strong>
				
				<br><br>
				
				Unlike that plucked carrot or bunch of dead grapes, a potato is still living when you harvest it, albeit in a dormant state. Warmth and moisture can cause the spuds to start sprouting, which is why you are supposed to keep them cool and dry. “Seed potatoes are cones of the original,” says Alison LaCourse, owner of The Maine Potato Lady seed purveyor. “So yes, that is how you do it: plant a potato and it sprouts.” Just keep in mind this won’t happen with many commercial potatoes since it’s a common practice to coat them with sprout killer, which snuffs out the spud’s life for good.

				<br><br>

				<strong>4. A sweet potato isn’t actually a potato</strong>
				
				<br><br>
				
				Sorry Southerners, but these vegetables aren’t actually part of the potato clan. “Sweet potatoes belong to the morning glory family (also known as the convolvulaceae family) and are actually swollen roots,” says LaCourse. “They are not related to the Irish Potato.” So, there you have it. The sweet potato is full of lies, just like the not-a-berry strawberry.

				<br><br>

				<strong>5. Potatoes were first grown in South America</strong>
				
				<br><br>
				
				Many people assume potatoes are Irish, or, at least, come from Idaho. While they grow in both places, the Inca Indians in Peru were the first to cultivate potatoes around 8,000 BC to 5,000 BC. This vegetable made its way to Europe aboard the Spanish conquistador ships around 1570, and though they planted potatoes in Spain, they mainly used the crop as livestock feed. Funnily enough, while the spud spread through Europe, it wasn’t embraced as the hearty, healthy food it is today. It wasn’t until 1662 that the Royal Society in England started to recommend cultivating potatoes, but still, eating the tubers didn’t take off for over a century. In 1795, the push to eat the nutritious vegetable finally sunk in, and soon it made its way to tables across the continent. As for the United States, potatoes didn’t make the Idaho farm scene until missionaries moved west and started planting them in 1836. It took another 40 or so years for them to flourish, a development that occurred with the onset of the Russet Burbank, still one of the most popular potatoes today.

				<br><br>

				<strong>6. Potatoes were the first vegetable grown in space</strong>
				
				<br><br>
				
				In a partnership between NASA and the University of Wisconsin, seed potatoes were first tested in space in 1995 aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia. Then, in 2004, NASA started using a Chinese technique to make the ultimate chamber-grown spud. It was dubbed Quantum Tubers™, and is possibly the most badass potato on the planet.

				<br><br>

				<strong>7. Potatoes can turn green</strong>
				
				<br><br>
				
				Yes, like with other plants, sunshine causes photosynthesis to occur in potatoes. So, if you want to avoid a green-skin tuber, keep your roots in a dry, dark place and away from pesky sunbeams.

				<br><br>

				<strong>8. Potatoes last a long time if you treat them right</strong>
				
				<br><br>
				
				First, if you are growing potatoes you need to make sure to dry them off after harvesting before you can store them. For those of you who just bought a bushel at the market, don’t bother washing the spuds before you put them away. In fact, that ruins the protective skin, so you are better off placing the dirt-encrusted tubers in a cool, dry and dark spot (like a root cellar if you are lucky enough to have one). They should last about six months this way, totally enough time to get you through the winter.

				<br><br>

				<strong>9. Potato chips, as we know them, were invented by mistake</strong>
				
				<br><br>
				
				Next time you are thrusting fistfuls of Lays in your mouth, keep in mind that if it wasn’t for the passive-aggressive move by chef George Crum in 1853, potato chips may never have been invented. As the story goes, Crum was head of the kitchen at Cary Moon’s Lake House in Saratoga, New York, a place where railroad mogul Cornelius Vanderbilt liked to dine. Vanderbilt wasn’t a fan of the thick-cut potatoes on his plate, so one day he sent them back to the kitchen, a move that annoyed the chef. In retaliation, Crum sliced the spuds as thinly as he could, fried them in oil with some salt, and turned them into crispy potatoes. Vanderbilt loved them, and the chef’s revenge turned out to be the genesis of one of America’s most popular snack foods.

				<br><br>

				<strong>10. Potatoes aren’t just for eating</strong>
				
				<br><br>

				For the Incans, a potato was more than just a food source. Lore had it that if you carried a tuber with you, it could prevent rheumatism or help soothe a toothache. They also used raw potato for treating ailments, from healing broken bones to easing frostbite to helping clear up of blemishes on the skin. Instead of taking a hot bath as we are prone to do, the Incans eased aches by rubbing the sore area with the water from a batch of boiled potatoes. Heck, they even used the spud to tell time, all based on how long it took for the root to cook.
